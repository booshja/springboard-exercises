## Pick Your Initial Project Ideas

### 1. Beer Finder (most interested)

Concept:

> Say you've been wanting a specific beer - An old favorite, or something new you'd like to try. This site would let you search for your favorite, and then get directions to the nearest bar or restaurant that serves it! You also would have the ability to create a profile where you can save your favorite beers to quickly be able to access them later on.

> >
> > - [Untappd API](https://untappd.com/api/docs#start) - Beer data and where it's served
> > - [Mapquest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/) - Geolocation and Directions

### 2. Cocktail Recipe Finder

Concept:

> As a bartender, there have been plenty of time that I've needed to look up a recipe. Whether it's a cocktail I simply haven't made in awhile, or one that's entirely new to me. It can be a daunting task to quickly decide which website to check, and whether it'll have the information when time is of the essence. You would also be able to create a profile to save drinks or searches for quick future reference. This would be aimed at working bartenders for an audience.
