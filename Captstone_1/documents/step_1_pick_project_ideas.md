## Pick Your Initial Project Ideas

### 1. SetlistPlaylist (most interested)

Concept:

> First - You've recently been to a concert you enjoy, or you're thinking back on a show you've been to in the past. You really enjoyed that band's set, and would like to relive the experience through the music. The app would take your favorite bands, and list dates for shows. You pick a show, and the app will display the setlist from that show, and give you the option to push a playlist to your spotify account of that show. Second - You've got a concert coming up, and you want to get a feel for what that band plays when they're touring, and based on what's popular at the moment. The app would allow you to pick that band, and it would generate and push that playlist to your spotify account to get you ready for the show! Pushing the playlists to the user's spotify account will be run through spotify's authorization, users will have to authorize access to their account that the app would route through spotify's api.

> > APIs:
> >
> > - [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - Spotify, links to songs, access to the user's account to create the playlists (API Key already received)
> > - [setlist.fm API](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html) - Setlists and Shows (API Key already received)

### 2. Cocktail Recipe Finder

Concept:

> As a bartender, there have been plenty of time that I've needed to look up a recipe. Whether it's a cocktail I simply haven't made in awhile, or one that's entirely new to me. It can be a daunting task to quickly decide which website to check, and whether it'll have the information when time is of the essence. You would also be able to create a profile to save drinks or searches for quick future reference. This would be aimed at working bartenders for an audience.

### 3. COVID-19 Data Tracker

Concept:

> To be able to view current overall statistics (current within a certain timeframe), as well as potentially local data. The ability to create a profile to save locations of interest, as well as specific filters.
